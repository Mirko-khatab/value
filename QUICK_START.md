## 💡 Tips

### Search Features

- Search works in **English, Kurdish, and Arabic**
- Try: "Erbil", "هەولێر", or "أربيل" - all find the same city!
- Search by country too: "Iraq" shows all Iraqi cities
- Partial matches work: "Sulay" finds "Sulaymaniyah"

### Adding Locations Fast

1. **From project form**: Use the modal (no reload!)
2. **Bulk add**: Go to Locations dashboard and add multiple at once
3. **SQL**: For many cities, use SQL INSERT (see main guide)

### Avoiding Errors

1. **Fill all three languages** - Don't leave any empty
2. **Check for duplicates** - Search before adding
3. **Select correct country** - Double-check the dropdown
4. **Can't delete?** - Item is being used, update projects first
