## 🗑️ Deprecated Files (Kept for Reference)

These files are no longer used but kept with `.deprecated` extension:

- `app/lib/aws-config.ts.deprecated` - Old AWS configuration
- `app/lib/s3-upload.ts.deprecated` - Old S3 upload functions

**Note:** You can safely delete these files once you're confident the migration is complete.

---

## 🔍 Verification Results

### Final Scan Results:

```bash
# Excluding deprecated files and false positives:
- Active AWS/S3 code references: 0
- Only remaining: Legacy function names with clarification comments
```

### False Positives (Not AWS-related):

- `Bars3Icon` in navigation.tsx (Heroicons icon name)
- `getFullS3Url()` function name (kept for backwards compatibility with clarification)

## 🎯 What Now Uses Cloud Storage

### Upload Operations

**Old:** AWS S3 with presigned URLs  
**New:** Your cloud storage API at `https://cloud.mirkokawa.dev/api`

**Upload endpoint:**

```
POST https://cloud.mirkokawa.dev/api/file/upload
Headers: X-API-Key: {CLOUD_API_KEY_FULL}
```

### File Access

**Old:** S3 URLs with CloudFront  
**New:** Direct public URLs with embedded read-only key

**Public URL format:**

```
https://cloud.mirkokawa.dev/api/public/{CLOUD_API_KEY_READ}/{FILE_ID}
```

### File Deletion

**Old:** AWS SDK DeleteObjectCommand  
**New:** DELETE request to cloud storage API

**Delete endpoint:**

```
DELETE https://cloud.mirkokawa.dev/api/file/{FILE_ID}
Headers: X-API-Key: {CLOUD_API_KEY_FULL}
```

   ```

2. **Remove AWS Environment Variables:**

   - Remove `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - Remove `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Remove `AWS_REGION`
   - Remove `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - Remove `CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN`

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash

   # This will install form-data and remove AWS SDK packages
   ```

4. **Build and Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## ⚠️ Migration Notes

### If You Have Existing Files in S3:

1. **Option 1: Keep Both Systems Temporarily**

   - New uploads go to cloud storage
   - Old files stay in S3
   - Gradually migrate when convenient

2. **Option 2: Migrate All Files**

   - Download all files from S3
   - Upload to cloud storage
   - Update database URLs
   - Decommission S3 bucket

3. **Option 3: Proxy Old URLs**
   - Keep S3 bucket read-only
   - Proxy old requests through your server
   - New uploads use cloud storage

### Database URL Updates

If you need to migrate existing URLs:

```sql
-- Example: Update old S3 URLs to cloud storage URLs
UPDATE products
SET video_url = REPLACE(
  video_url,
  'https://old-s3-url.com/',
  'https://cloud.mirkokawa.dev/api/public/{YOUR_KEY}/'
);
```
