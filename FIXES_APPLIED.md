# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ TypeScript Error Fixed

**Error**: `Type '() => Promise<{ message: string; }>' is not assignable to type 'string | ((formData: FormData) => void | Promise<void>)'`

**Solution**:

- Changed delete functions to throw errors instead of returning objects
- Updated all delete buttons to catch and display errors
- Files fixed:
  - `app/lib/actions.ts` - deleteLocation, deleteCountry, deleteProjectCategory
  - `app/ui/location/delete-button.tsx`
  - `app/ui/country/delete-button.tsx`
  - `app/ui/project-category/delete-button.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Delete Protection Added

All items now check if they're in use before deleting:

**Countries**:

- ❌ Cannot delete if it has locations
- ✅ Shows error: "Cannot delete country. It has X location(s) associated with it."

**Locations**:

- ❌ Cannot delete if used in projects
- ✅ Shows error: "Cannot delete location. It is used in X project(s)."

**Project Categories**:

- ❌ Cannot delete if used in projects
- ✅ Shows error: "Cannot delete category. It is used in X project(s)."

### 3. ✅ Navigation Menu Updated

Added to dashboard sidebar navigation:

- 🗺️ **Locations** - `/dashboard/locations`
- 🌍 **Countries** - `/dashboard/countries`

Now appears in the menu between:

- Projects
- Project Categories
- **→ Locations** (NEW)
- **→ Countries** (NEW)
- Products
- (rest of menu...)

## How to Use

### Delete Protection in Action

1. Go to Dashboard → Countries
2. Try to delete "Iraq"
3. ❌ Alert appears: "Cannot delete country. It has 43 location(s) associated with it."
4. Must delete all Iraqi cities first (or reassign them)

**Try to delete a location used in projects:**

1. Go to Dashboard → Locations
2. Try to delete a city used in a project
3. ❌ Alert appears: "Cannot delete location. It is used in X project(s)."
4. Must update those projects first

**Try to delete a category used in projects:**

1. Go to Dashboard → Project Categories
2. Try to delete a category
3. ❌ Alert appears: "Cannot delete category. It is used in X project(s)."
4. Must update/delete those projects first

### Navigation

All CRUD pages now accessible from sidebar:

- **Projects** → List, Create, Edit, Delete
- **Project Categories** → List, Create, Edit, Delete (with protection)
- **Locations** → List, Create, Edit, Delete (with protection)
- **Countries** → List, Create, Edit, Delete (with protection)

## Files Modified

### Delete Functions (app/lib/actions.ts)

```typescript
// Changed from returning { message } to throwing errors
export async function deleteCountry(id: string) {
  // ... check if in use ...
  if (locations[0].count > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot delete country. It has ${count} location(s).`);
  }
  // ... delete ...
}

export async function deleteLocation(id: string) {
  // ... check if in use ...
  if (projects[0].count > 0) {
    throw new Error(
      `Cannot delete location. It is used in ${count} project(s).`
    );
  }
  // ... delete ...
}

export async function deleteProjectCategory(id: string) {
  // ... check if in use ...
  if (projects[0].count > 0) {
    throw new Error(
      `Cannot delete category. It is used in ${count} project(s).`
    );
  }
  // ... delete ...
}
```

### Delete Buttons

All updated to catch errors and show alerts:

- `app/ui/location/delete-button.tsx`
- `app/ui/country/delete-button.tsx`
- `app/ui/project-category/delete-button.tsx`

```typescript
try {
  await deleteLocation(id);
} catch (error: any) {
  alert(error.message || "Failed to delete");
}
```

### Navigation (app/lib/utils.ts)

Added icons and links:

```typescript
{ name: "Locations", href: "/dashboard/locations", icon: MapPinIcon },
{ name: "Countries", href: "/dashboard/countries", icon: GlobeAltIcon },
```
