- Use case selector (Landing, Intro, Both)

### ✅ Audio Player Controls

- **Play/Stop Button**:
  - Orange stop icon = Audio currently playing
  - Green play icon = Audio stopped

### ✅ Automatic Features

- Only loads audio when active in database

### ✅ Admin Panel

- Easy-to-use forms with validation

## Setup Required

### 1. Database

Run the SQL script to create the audios table:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < database-schema-audio.sql
```

### 2. Upload Audio

1. Go to `/dashboard/audios`
2. Click "Add Audio"
3. Upload your audio file
4. Set it to Active
5. Choose where to use it (Landing/Intro/Both)

## How It Works

1. **Admin uploads audio** through dashboard
2. **Audio stored in S3** with unique URL
3. **Database stores** metadata and settings
4. **API endpoint** fetches active audio based on page type
5. **Audio player component** renders controls and plays audio
6. **User can control** playback with mute/stop buttons

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Auto-play may be blocked by browser policies
- Users can manually start playback with Play button

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the database migration script
2. ✅ Upload your desired audio files
3. ✅ Test the audio player on landing and intro pages
4. ✅ Adjust audio volume in your files if needed
5. ✅ Deploy to production
